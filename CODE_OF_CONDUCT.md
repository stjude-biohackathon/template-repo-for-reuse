# Code of Conduct

> Code of Conduct, commonly abbreviated as “CoC”, is a set of rules outlining the social norms, rules, & responsibilities of an individual project, party or organization.

In this repository, we use St. Jude's Code of Conduct document, outlining our expectations for 
all participants.
